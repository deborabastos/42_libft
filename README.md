# Libft

This is my first project as a Cadet in [42 School SÃ£o Paulo](https://www.42sp.org.br/).

The goal of this project is to build my own C library. In order to accomplish it,  I'll re-code some of the most important functions available on C Standard library among other useful functions suggested by 42 staff. As course goes, new functions will be added to fullfill the needs of my following projects.

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| **ft_atoi** | converts the initial portion of the string pointed to by str into integer |
|  **ft_bzero**  | writes n zeroed bytes to the string s |
