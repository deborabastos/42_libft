# Libft

This is my first project as a Cadet in [42 School SÃ£o Paulo](https://www.42sp.org.br/).

The goal of this project is to build my own C library. In order to accomplish it,  I'll re-code some of the most important functions available on C Standard library among other useful functions suggested by 42 staff. As course goes, new functions will be added to fullfill the needs of my following projects.

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
|**ft_atoi**| converts the initial portion of the string pointed to by str into integer |
|**ft_bzero**| writes n zeroed bytes to the string s |
|**ft_calloc**| allocates the requested memory and returns a pointer to it |
|**ft_count_digit**| counts how many digits the integer has |
|**ft_count_words**| counts how many words has a string |
|**ft_div_mod**| divides parameters a by b and stores the result in the int pointed by div. It also stores the remainder of the division of a by b in the int pointed by mod |
|**ft_factorial**| returns the result of a factorial operation based on the number given as a parameter |
|**ft_fibonacci**| returns the n-th element of the Fibonacci sequence, the first element being at the 0 index |
|**ft_gnl**| reads every line of a file |
|**ft_isalnum**| checks if a character c is alphabetical or numerical |
|**ft_isalpha**| checks if character c is a alphabetic |
|**ft_isascii**|  checks whether c is a 7-bit unsigned char value that fits into the ASCII character set |
|**ft_isblank**| checks for a blank character; that is, a space or a tab |
|**ft_iscntrl**| checks if a character c is NOT printable according to ASCII table |
|**ft_isdigit**|  checks if a character c corresponds to a decimal digit character (48 to 57 at ASCII) |
|**ft_isgraph**| checks for any printable character except space |
|**ft_islower**| checks if c is a lower-case letter |
|**ft_isnegative**| checks if a number is negative |
|**ft_isprime**| return 1 if a number is prime and 0 if is not |
|**ft_isprint**| tests if a character c is printable according to ASCII table, including space |
|**ft_ispunct**| checks for any printable character which is not a space or an alphanumeric character |
|**ft_isspace**|  tests for white-space characters. That is: form-feed ('\f'), newline ('\n'), carriage return ('\r'), horizontal tab ('\t'), and vertical tab ('\v') |
|**ft_isupper**|  tests if c is a upper-case letter |
|**ft_isxdigit**| checks for a hexadecimal digits, that is, one of 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 a b c d e f A B C D E F |
