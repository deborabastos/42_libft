# Libft

This is my first project as a Cadet in [42 School SÃ£o Paulo](https://www.42sp.org.br/).

The goal of this project is to build my own C library. In order to accomplish it,  I'll re-code some of the most important functions available on C Standard library among other useful functions suggested by 42 staff. As course goes, new functions will be added to fullfill the needs of my following projects.

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| **ft_atoi** | converts the initial portion of the string pointed to by str into integer |
| **ft_bzero** | writes n zeroed bytes to the string s |
| **ft_calloc** | allocates the requested memory and returns a pointer to it |
| **ft_count_digit** | counts how many digits the integer has |
| **ft_count_words** | counts how many words has a string |
| **ft_div_mod** | divides parameters a by b and stores the result in the int pointed by div. It also stores the remainder of the division of a by b in the int pointed by mod |
| **ft_factorial** | returns the result of a factorial operation based on the number given as a parameter |
|**ft_fibonacci**| returns the n-th element of the Fibonacci sequence, the first element being at the 0 index |
| **ft_gnl** | reads every line of a file |
| **ft_isalnum**|---|
